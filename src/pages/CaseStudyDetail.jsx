      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        PTS partnered with a leading Oil & Gas company to implement advanced BIM workflows, significantly reducing
        design errors and construction delays. The project involved 3D modeling, clash detection, and integrated
        engineering collaboration tools.

        Our Solution
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        We deployed Autodesk Revit and Navisworks for 3D modeling and clash detection, combined with cloud-based
        collaboration platforms for real-time coordination. Our engineers provided on-site and remote support for
        smooth execution.
